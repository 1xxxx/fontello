Website: [fontello.com](http://fontello.com/)

This tool helps to combine iconic webfonts for your project. With fontello you can:

1. shink glyphs collections, minimizing font size
2. merge symbols from several fonts to single file
3. access large sets of professional-grade open source icons

Now it's trivial to make custom iconic webfont, exactly for your needs.
First, select icons you like. Then update glyph codes (optionally), and
download webfont bundle. We generate all you need, ready to publish on your
website!

Don't forget about dontation... of some icons, under open source licence :) .
It will be the best gratis for our work.


## Embedded Fonts <a name="embedded"></a>

Fontello comes with embetted set of iconic fonts:

- [__Entypo__](http://www.entypo.com/) by Daniel Bruce (CC BY-SA license)
- [__Font Awesome__](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome//) by Dave Gandy (CC BY-SA license)
- [__Iconic__](https://github.com/somerandomdude/Iconic) by P.J. Onori (SIL OFL)
- [__Brandico__](https://github.com/fontello/brandico.font) by... all :) (SIL OFL)

Please, note, that embedded fonts differ from originals. We did some
transformations, to make all characteristics unified (scale, ascent/descent,
alignement). If you need specific details - look into updated fonts repos
on [github](https://github.com/fontello/).
