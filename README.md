Fontello - iconic fonts scissors
================================

[Website](http://nodeca.github.com/fontomas/)

This tool helps to combine iconic webfonts for your project. With fontello you can:

1. make a limited symbols subset, minimizing font size
2. merge symbols from several fonts to single file
3. access large collections of professional-grade open source icons

Now it's trivial to customise fonts for your needs with 3 simple steps.
First, select the symbols you want from the source fonts. Then rearrange those
in the destination font. After that, you can download a bundle with files, ready
for deplayment on your site.

Don't forget about dontation... of some icons, under open source licence :) .
It will be the best gratis for our work.


## Embedded Fonts <a name="embedded"></a>

Fontello comes with embetted set of iconic fonts:

Please, note, that embedded font differ from originals. We did some transformations,
to make all characteristics unified (scale, ascent/descent, alignement). If you need
more details - each font has separate repo on [github](https://github.com/fontello/).
