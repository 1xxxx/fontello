Fontello - iconic fonts scissors
================================

Website: [fontello.com](http://fontello.com/)

This tool lets you combine iconic webfonts for your own project. With fontello you can:

1. shrink glyph collections, minimizing font size
2. merge symbols from several fonts into a single file
3. access large sets of professional-grade open source icons

Now it's trivial to make a custom iconic webfont, exactly for your needs.
First, select the icons you like. Then update glyph codes (optional), and
download your webfont bundle. We generate everything you need, ready for publishing
on your website!

Don't forget about donations :)
