Fontomas - iconic fonts scissors
================================

[Run right now in your browser!](http://nodeca.github.com/fontomas/) This tool
helps to combine iconic webfonts for your project. With fontomas you can:

1. make a limited symbols subset, with reduced font size
2. merge symbols from several sources to single file
3. remap symbol codes & even make them compatible with book readers

No installation needed - only modern browser. Now it's trivial to customise
fonts for your needs with 3 simple step. At first, you select needed symbols
on source fonts. Then rearrange those on destination font. After that, you can
download SVG font and make webpack via fontsquirel or other services.

All your progress is automatically stored locally.


## Embedded Fonts

For your convenience, Fontomas comes with wonderful embedded iconic fonts:

- __Iconic__ - https://github.com/somerandomdude/Iconic
- __Web Symbols__ - http://www.justbenicestudio.com/studio/websymbols/

Those fonts are distributed under OFL licence, and don't add restrictions on
both personal and commercial use. See details on fonts homepages. Of cause,
you can add more fonts if you wish.


## We need your help!
